// Compound Components

import React from 'react'
import {Switch} from '../switch'

class Toggle extends React.Component {
  // you can create function components as static properties!
  // for example:
  // static Candy = props => <div>CANDY! {props.children}</div>
  // Then that could be used like: <Toggle.Candy />
  // This is handy because it makes the relationship between the
  // parent Toggle component and the child Candy component more explicit
  // üê® You'll need to create three such components here: On, Off, and Button
  //    The button will be responsible for rendering the <Switch /> (with the right props)
  // üí∞ Combined with changes you'll make in the `render` method, these should
  //    be able to accept `on`, `toggle`, and `children` as props.
  //    Note that they will _not_ have access to Toggle instance properties
  //    like `this.state.on` or `this.toggle`.

  KEVIN NOTES
  everything is circular here...
  static On = props => (...) gives possible 
    <Toggle> 
      <Toggle.Static> 
        the button is on 
      </Toggle.Static> 
    </Toggle>
  
  where props.children is "the button is on"

  the magic comes from 
    return React.cloneElement(childElement, {
      on: this.state.on,
      toggle: this.toggle,
    })
  
  through cloneElement, Toggle.Static gets a prop called 'on' where it inherits Toggle's on and off state
  it also inherits toggle action that the Button uses as a prop
  */
  static On = props => (props.on ? props.children : null)
  static Off = props => (props.on ? null : props.children)
  static Button = ({on, toggle}) => (
    <Switch on={on} onClick={toggle} />
  )

  state = {on: false}
  toggle = () =>
    this.setState(
      ({on}) => ({on: !on}),
      () => this.props.onToggle(this.state.on),
    )
  render() {
    // we're trying to let people render the components they want within the Toggle component.
    // But the On, Off, and Button components will need access to the internal `on` state as
    // well as the internal `toggle` function for them to work properly. So here we can
    // take all this.props.children and make a copy of them that has those props.
    //
    // To do this, you can use:
    // 1. React.Children.map: https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactchildrenmap
    // 2. React.cloneElement: https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#cloneelement
    //
    // üê® you'll want to completely replace the code below with the above logic.
    // const {on} = this.state
    // return <Switch on={on} onClick={this.toggle} />

    // this.props.children.map works in our case too...but
    // it has a weird edge case...it must have more than 1+ element...
    // otherwise it assigns children to the lone child...
    return React.Children.map(this.props.children, childElement => {
      return React.cloneElement(childElement, {
        on: this.state.on,
        toggle: this.toggle,
      })
    })

    /*
    KEVIN NOTES

    return React.Children.map(this.props.children, childElement => {
      ....
    }

    this magic line grabs each of Toggle's direct children
      i.e. Toggle.On, Toggle.Off, Toggle.Button
    and blesses each of them props where we connect the state and action of their Parent Toggle

    think of Compound Components like these as...
    <Toggle>
      <Toggle.On>
      <Toggle.Off>
      <Toggle.Button>
    </Toggle>

    as...

    <select>
      <option>
      <option>
      <option>
    <select>

    both work in harmony together...and its children really don't make any sense without their parents
